Spam or Ham Detection Project

This project aims to classify emails or messages as spam (unsolicited and typically irrelevant messages sent over the Internet to a large number of users) or ham (legitimate messages). Utilizing machine learning algorithms, this project provides a solution to efficiently filter out unwanted emails, enhancing user experience by allowing them to focus on important messages.
